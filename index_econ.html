              Large-scale consumption reduction is an absolute good for the
              economy. This might not seem obvious: What about jobs? To
              understand my claim, we need to go down to the very basics of
              economy. We need a fundamental definition of the term. To do so,
              we must first define society.
            </p>
            <p>Society is a group of human beings surviving together.</p>
            <p>
              To survive, a number of tasks must be performed. These tasks
              require labor. Humans living together will want to create a form
              of labor distribution to make sure the tasks are performed
              securely and effectively.
            </p>
            <p>
              The economy is a system that society employs to make sure the
              tasks of survival are performed.

          <article class="article-story">
            <p>
              What are the immediate tasks of survival? Food. Heating. Housing.
              Water. Protection from the environment. Removal of waste. Let us
              make up a name for performing these tasks:
              <b>first-order value creation</b>. Any labor that provides these
              basic needs – as well as any labor that provides energy,
              materials, capital and transportation that directly facilitates
              these tasks – should be considered the most important functions of
              the economy. Society must at all times make sure these tasks are
              fulfilled for its members, or society will unravel.
            </p>
            <p>
              But society must also endure over time, which presents a different
              set of tasks. We define <b>second-order value creation</b> like
              this: activities required for allowing first-order tasks to run
              smoothly, predictably and across generations. This expands the
              scope of our economy massively: healthcare, education, emergency
              services, law and order, planning, administration. Like for the
              first order, this sector also includes all subsidiary activity –
              the production of materials, capital, transportation and energy
              required for second-order processes.
            </p>
            <p>
              Finally, we can define <b>third-order value creation</b> as the
              research and development of technologies and methods that improve
              first and second order processes, making them less labor
              intensive.
            </p>
            <p>
              Any activity that cannot be categorized within these three orders,
              is not strictly required for society’s survival, and can be
              considered luxury.

              The exact placement of a business or sector in this system might
              be subjective or relative. The lists of examples above are not
              exhaustive. But it should be safe to say that the industrial and
              economical activity that goes into making products and services
              for over-consumption – and which drive a significant part of
              climate change – does not belong in any of the three orders. That
              is the cornerstone of this analysis.
            </p>
            <p>
              Before we move on, we need to deal with two core misunderstandings
              in economics, that block any meaningful discussion of the impact
              of consumption reduction: Misunderstanding 1: Society needs to
              have as much money as possible. Misunderstanding 2: Society needs
              to have as many jobs as possible. These misunderstandings come
              from the personal economy. For the individual’s survival, money is
              everything, and money comes from having a job. And these clauses
              get extrapolated to the societal level, and become universal
              principles of the economy.

              Money is a mechanism created and sustained by society to
              distribute scarce resources. Other systems of distribution can be
              imagined, but money is the system that endures, historically. But
              the economy is not about the money, it is about the resources.
              Those resources are labor, capital, energy and materials. Your
              economy’s access to labor, capital, energy and materials, is the
              hard limit to what number of tasks that your society can fulfill.
              Money is an artificial device that does not solve tasks on its
              own, it just motivates humans to allocate the labor, capital,
              energy and resources for task solving. You solve tasks for other
              people at your workplace, in return for money that you can use to
              make other people solve your tasks (like food, housing, leisure,
              and so on).
            </p>
            <p>
              The amount of money in a society should match its access to labor,
              capital, energy and materials. If society has too much money, bad
              things happen: People start thinking that more tasks can be
              fulfilled than what is physically possible, creating a gap between
              expectations and reality (also known as inflation). When the gap
              becomes apparent, the result is political instability, as citizens
              realize less of their needs are fulfilled than they think, and
              they start searching for someone to blame.
            </p>
            <p>
              Many societies think that they need to have many businesses that
              earn money by exporting goods and services to other societies, so
              that they can use this money domestically to provide their
              citizens with better services. This is faulty thinking, because
              exports do not automatically create the labor, energy and
              materials required for producing services. To a degree, these can
              be imported, but the utility is limited: Schools cannot be manned
              by foreign teachers, and many materials are required in such great
              physical quantities, or with such immediacy, that they cannot
              meaningfully be delivered from afar. A great many tasks of society
              can only be solved with domestic inputs.
            </p>
            <p>
              Foreign money can only really be used to buy things from
              foreigners. Many things need to be imported, as societies cannot
              hope to have expertise for the domestic production of everything,
              and high-expertise production should be centralized anyway, for
              efficiency reasons. But a lot of consumer products are imported,
              and if over-consumption goes down, this will reduce the need for
              foreign money, which will reduce the need for export industries.
              The labor, capital, energy and materials previously disappearing
              into exports can then be used for better domestic service
              production.

              Labor unions and socialism has benefited society in a great number
              of ways, However, they have also given society a job-centric view
              of the economy, to a point where jobs justify their own existence.
              What is a job? A job is a place, or a condition, where labor is
              used to fulfill a task of society. The task is the purpose of the
              job. If the task does not exist, nor should the job – jobs without
              tasks is waste of labor. There are always more tasks, and labor is
              always scarce. Unemployment is simply society’s failure to order
              tasks by their necessity; misunderstandings driven by political
              ideology and/or ignorance, equipping laborers for the wrong task.
            </p>
            <p>
              Recall the purpose of the economy: solving the tasks required for
              the survival of human beings living together. The economy exists
              to solve tasks, not to create them – which is exactly what you do
              when you center the economy on the job. When all necessary tasks
              are completed, there is no more work – only leisure. This should
              be the economical ideal of society. This ideal is far off yet, as
              jobs are the only means of sustenance for most people. That
              society goes on like this, with people being bound to wage labor,
              is due to the scarcity of life necessities. What causes this
              scarcity? Over-production and over-consumption of non-necessary
              products and services. The massive increase in productivity
              brought about by industrialization and automation should be enough
              to provide all people with all their life necessities. Instead, it
              goes into providing the upper and middle classes with ever more
              objects of consumption.
            </p>
            <p>
              Let us see the same thing from another perspective: What happens
              when there are more jobs than people, due to politicians
              constantly pushing the job-creation ideal of policy? When there
              are too many jobs, some will not have people to do them. Which
              jobs are those going to be? The ones that cannot compete on wages
              and working conditions. What determines wages and working
              conditions? The wealth of the employer. What employers are the
              wealthiest? The ones dealing with luxury services and products. In
              other words: When there are too many jobs, first order value
              creation competes for labor with disadvantage with second and
              third order, which again compete poorly with the luxury sector.
              Too many jobs in the labor market, hurts society’s ability to
              provide for its citizens’ needs.

            <h4>Over-Consumtion</h4>
            <p>
              We should not be afraid to fight over-consumption, even when it
              hurts businesses and employment. Quite the opposite. In the
              economy of an over-consuming society, luxury production drains
              labor, energy and materials from the more critical parts of the
              economy. And because they create jobs and earn money, nobody sees
              the problem, because we are all used to thinking that jobs and
              money is all that there is to the economy! And while our wealth is
              focused on consuming, instead of providing basic necessities, said
              necessities deteriorate. Hospitals, nursing homes, kindergartens
              and schools are under-staffed. People are overworked to afford
              their own needs, and find escape in unhealthy food and inactivity,
              in alcohol and drugs, and in vandalism and bullying.
            </p>

            <p>
              And we cannot for our dear life understand why this happens, in
              our wealthy society! Only one answer presents itself to us: This
              is caused by people with evil intentions, immoral politicians. As
              trust falls, so does governments, and politicians look for simpler
              problems to solve, to stay in power. Anti-immigration and
              anti-abortion policies are simple. Moral conservatism follows,
              sexual minorities are next. And if politicians do not go far
              enough, the population will organize the extremism by themselves:
              MAGA, Yellow Vests, neo-nazis.
            </p>

            <p>
              Reduced over-consumption will save more than just the environment.
              It will save the economy. The welfare state. Democracy itself.
              Western civilization as we know it.

            <h4>A part of the cake</h4>
            <p>
              Speaking of the West, what about the non-West? How fare developing
              countries, whole economies geared toward providing the West with
              low-cost consumer goods in significant volumes, when this market
              dries up? In the short run: Not so well, probably. In the long
              run, however, I believe a massive reduction in Western resource
              use is what actually will serve to lift the developing world out
              of poverty.
            </p>
            <p>
              We can look at two different kinds of poverty: extreme (2.12 2018
              dollars a day) and general (6.85 dollars). The number of extremely
              poor in the world has fallen from 2 billion in 1990 to 0.7 billion
              in 2022 (but noticeably not to 0). The number of generally poor
              counted 3.5 billion in 1990, and still do. Globalized industry and
              trade was supposed to fix this. Now we’ve been doing it for a
              generation, and we are only inching closer to the end of poverty.
              I believe the globalized trade in consumer goods is the problem,
              more than the solution. The system locks developing countries into
              a form of semi-industrialization, with all the costs of the
              industrial revolution and none of the benefits.
            </p>
            <p>
              Industrialization was supposed to be the panacea for poverty – it
              was to transform the developing countries like it once transformed
              the West. But the industrial revolution of the West was a unique
              historical event. The West built factories for its own use. They
              created value by providing their own citizens with labor-saving
              mass produced goods, improving the capabilities of the economy,
              and the state, laying the groundwork for robust democracy. All
              because the value created by industry remained within the country.
              The developing countries, on the other hand, produce goods for
              export – which means the created value leaves the country. The
              country is left with exhausted workers, infrastructural costs,
              pollution and bribed officials.
            </p>
            <h4>What are goods actually worth?</h4>
            <p>
              They get paid. Only a fraction of what the goods would have
              fetched if they were produced in the West, though – but developing
              countries are low-cost communities, so it is supposed to even out.
              This outlook makes no sense, of course – as we have seen from the
              analysis of the West, the income from exports have only one real
              application: paying for imports. And for a developing country,
              imports will be very expensive, because imports come from a global
              market where the prices are set by the West’s ability to purchase.
              The developing countries export far more value than they import,
              an asymmetry that massively favors the West, and is the foundation
              for our affluent lifestyles.
            </p>
            <p>
              This locks the developing countries in an evil circle: Because
              most of the value they produce leave the country, and only a
              trickle returns as over-priced imports, the resource basis for
              stable democracy never forms. To build a democracy that lasts, you
              need political trust. To get trust, politicians need to be able to
              serve the needs of their citizens. And to do that, you need a
              comfortable level of material wealth, which the system denies you
              – and only affluent democracies get to define their role in the
              system. This system allows the West to sustain its current level
              of superior material affluence, which means the West will never
              allow the system to change. Developing countries becoming
              democracies, spending their labor, energy and materials on
              themselves instead of exporting, would essentially destroy the
              economy of the West, which is dependent on getting things for
              cheap from poorer countries.

              When a popular movement to reduce over-consumption arises in the
              affluent democracies, the system will change. Societies geared as
              suppliers of consumer goods will find themselves with a shortfall
              of customers. What they must do to get through the transition
              period, I do not know, but one thing is given: The labor, energy
              and materials required to make a transition to domestic
              industrialization, and then democracy, will now be readily
              available, when the West no longer sucks most of it into its
              luxury consumption.

            <h2>Final Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
              We should not be afraid to fight over-consumption, even when it
              would appear to hurt developing countries who have made themselves
              dependent on supplying us with cheap consumer goods. This
              economical system one of the chief reasons developing countries
              remain poor, and until it is removed, they stand no chance
              creating for themselves the domestic wealth required for the
              political trust that a stable democracy can be built upon.
