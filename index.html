              "The failure of today's effort against climate change is due to a
              fundamental lack of understanding of this force; why it exists,

            Once upon a time, there was a man who lived in a village in the
            jungle. In the jungle, there was a tiger, and the man knew the tiger
            would come at night and eat him. The man held council with the other
            men of the village, and they came up with a plan: They would raise a
            fence all around the village, every man contributing ten meters. The
            man went home, built ten meters of fence, and went to bed. At night,
            the tiger entered his house and ate him. You see, his neighbor had
            built no fence, for he saw no need for hurry. And his neighbor had
            built no fence, for he had lost his arms in an accident. And his
            neighbor had built no fence, for he did not believe in tigers.
          </p>

          <p>
            The moral lesson of this story is the simplest you can think of: It
            is not about the ten meters of fence. It is about the tiger, about
            not getting eaten. When the tiger enters your home, it is too late
            to try something different, or cry injustice. If your plan cannot
            reliably protect you from the tiger, you need a new plan, no matter
            how much thought and effort you put into your ten meters of fence.
            Not getting eaten by the tiger is the only objective of the plan –
            all else is a distraction.

            <h4>Another Story: Mahatma Gandhi</h4>
            <p>
              On the 12th of March 1930, a man known to history as Mahatma
              Gandhi set off towards Dandi at the eastern coast of India, along
              with 78 companions, to illegally extract salt from the ocean.
              Soon, millions of Indians all over joined this act of mass civil
              disobedience against British rule. Gandhi had favored salt as the
              object of political action because of its ubiquitous role in every
              Indian's household, rich or poor. And although the British
              response was harsh, and there were no immediate concessions, the
              Salt March is today known as a cornerstone event of the Indian
              independence movement, proving how simple acts of resistance were
              within reach of anyone. And to us, the event teaches another
              lesson: The economy is an immensely potent target for political
              action, to bring about needed change.

            <h4>To the Point</h4>
            <p>
              Climate change can be solved, and must be solved. The current
              global climate mitigation effort is helplessly steering towards
              total failure, for logical reasons that will be made clear in this
              text. A new movement of climate action is required, tailor made
              for realistically countering root causes of climate change. The
              movement must be built around an idea so straight-forward,
              reasonable and fair that anyone can pick it up at once. This
              solutions exists, and will be made clear over the course of this
              text, in all necessary detail. The only missing element is
              leadership. It could be you.
            </p>
            <p>
              Climate change is caused by the middle and upper class
              population's demand for consumer goods/services and energy. The
              economics of billions of human beings cooperating for this end,
              devising governments and industries to do their bidding, is an
              immensely powerful force headed for global ecosystem collapse. The
              failure of today's effort against climate change is due to a
              fundamental lack of understanding of this force; why it exists,
              what makes it so powerful, and where it can and cannot be fought.
            </p>
            <p>
              The situation requires a mass popular movement against private
              over-consumption. Using the tried and tested tool of social
              influence through conformity, mankind's destructive drive towards
              ever-increasing material wealth can be halted. Start out simple:
              Increase the emotional labor required for shopping, as your
              activists line the entrances of malls. Then watch your ranks grow
              as citizens realize that the means to stop the doomsday clock of
              climate change are in fact not out of reach, but are simple,
              logical and just. Any decrease in consumption will be matched by
              an immediate decrease in emissions, which is the one thing the
              world needs now. And as the public transforms through your
              movement, watch how the green transition becomes a juggernaut, as
              paralysis, procrastination and cultural war turns into united
              determination: We can slay the tiger.

          <blockquote>

            </p>

          <p>
            Before moving on to the method in detail, here are a few statements
            to show the way of thinking that underpins the whole. You need to be
            able to think like this to reach the conclusions of the method. If
            these statements are offensive or unacceptable to you, you are
            unlikely to find what you seek in the remainder of this text.
          </p>

          <h4>1. Your personal climate-friendly acts are pointless.</h4>
          <p>
            Climate change is a big, big, problem, caused by emissions from the
            activities of billions of human beings. Riding the bus, going vegan,
            buying second-hand – none of these actions will move the situation
            anywhere near the non-catastrophic conditions that is the goal. The
            idea that if you do your part, then everyone else will do their
            part, is a self-deception. And this idea is unfortunately the
            cornerstone of the entire climate mitigation paradigm – protesters,
            consumer choices, national emission targets, and so on. In reality,
            you have no way to assure yourself that this is happening. If your
            goal is to stop the tiger, you need to be certain beyond any doubt
            that all the men of the village are building their ten meters of
            fence each. And you just don’t have that kind of power or knowledge.
            To survive the climate crisis, you need to create a system that
            enforces climate mitigation everywhere.
          </p>

          <h4>
            2. The oil industry is not the cause of climate change, just the
            medium that the cause works through.
          </h4>
          <p>
            The oil industry was created by society to deliver fuel. If you
            removed it, society would quickly devise another way to get fuel.
            The wealth of the industry comes from the high value the consumers
            place on the product. The power of the industry comes from society
            looking the other way from their crimes and transgressions, to make
            sure the fuel supply is uninterrupted. The activist movement sees a
            separation between the oil industry and society; this is an
            illusion. Without society’s demand for fossil fuel, there is no oil
            industry. With society’s demand for fossil fuel, there will always
            be an oil industry.
          </p>

          <h4>
            3. Politicians are just doing their job as representatives of the
            majority, and will not obey activists.
          </h4>
          <p>
            “How dare you?” cried Greta Thunberg upon meeting the world leaders.
            The leaders were there as elected representatives for their
            societies. They dared to, because they did not dare not to. A
            politician who changes course by own initiative and begins accepting
            concessions for the climate on behalf of voters who did not ask for
            them, gets replaced by a politician who will remain loyal to the
            voting majority. Activists regard politicians as flawed, immoral
            individuals – this is a false premise. Elected politicians are no
            better or worse than the society that chose them as representatives
            of itself. Activists want to hold politicians responsible. That is
            like punishing the hands for the decisions of the head.
          </p>

          <h4>
            4. There are two ways to influence in society: money and approval.
            Political protest is falsely regarded as a third way.
          </h4>
          <p>
            Protest and civil disobedience only works when there is significant
            hidden or unaware approval for the cause – such as was the case for
            Gandhi’s India. Attention is a currency, which you spend to get
            noticed by those who might support you with their numbers. A
            currency that cannot be spent to get what you want, is worthless. If
            you cannot quickly convert your attention into power, society’s eyes
            will soon move on. Activists perform spectacular protests to make
            demands from politicians. But without power, you do not have demands
            – you just have wishes, to be ignored by anyone who does not share
            them. Power comes in two forms: physical, in the form of arms or
            wealth, and popular, from ranks of people whom you have convinced to
            your cause. The activist movement does not have the former, for
            obvious reasons. More worryingly, it makes no serious attempt for
            the latter either, thinking that spectacular protests is a short cut
            to influence. And thus, the movement makes no significant impact.

            <p>
              Yes, there are multiple exceptions – on the micro level, in the
              details. On the macro level, however, the claims hold true:
              Industry and politicians are the means with which society performs
              specific tasks, and they are governed by a few straight-forward
              principles of material interest. And the macro level is where
              climate change happens, and where we need to think if we are to
              design a cure.

          <p>
            The method for dealing with climate change is a popular movement
            protesting private overconsumption. What this means is the act of
            gathering people to protest other people's over-consumption at or
            near the locations where these people make the choice to
            over-consume.
          </p>
          <article class="protest-question article-story">
            <h4>Did you not just say that protest is pointless?</h4>
            <p>
              Political protest is pointless, because politicians are steered by
              forces much greater, and by people far more numerous, than climate
              protesters. Unless you can make very very many people join your
              rally, politicians are immune. Protest against other individuals,
              however, is not pointless, because on their own, human beings are
              very susceptible to being influenced – in particular by crowds.
              This is the power of social influence: enforcer of laws, builder
              of world religions, shaper of cultures. The oldest form of power,
              immensely potent. All you need is numbers, and for numbers you
              need a cause and leadership.

          <article class="purpose article-story">
            <h4>What is the purpose of this protest, in plain words?</h4>
            <p>Two things:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                1. To increase the emotional labor required for over-consumption
              </li>
              <li>
                2. To show all people that an effective form of climate action
                is possible, and within reach for anyone.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              These two are interconnected: the tool for causing emission cuts,
              and the hand that wields the tool. The climate movement has no
              impact without a method. A method for emission cuts, no matter how
              logical, can do nothing without a movement.

          <article class="over-consumption article-story">
            <h4>Why over-consumption, of all purposes?</h4>
            <p>For a number of reasons.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                1. Consumption is the end purpose of nearly all industry, with
                its fossil fuel demand, and unnecessary consumption is a
                significant chunk of that. Reducing over-consumption instantly
                reduces the demand and use of fossil fuels, and the emissions
                that follow. Instant emission cuts, just what the climate needs.
                Can you think of any other form of climate action that works
                immediately?
              </li>
              <li>
                2. Over-consumption can be removed from the economy with no ill
                effects to society, apart from the short-term displacement of
                laborers. See ECONOMICS (link) for a much deeper discussion of
                this premise.
              </li>
              <li>
                3. It is perfectly fair and moral. The majority of the world’s
                population does not have the privilege of getting to buy a new
                mobile phone whenever they’re tired of the old, or fly to
                foreign countries on vacation, or eat meat in abundance. Yet
                many of these same people will be suffering the most under the
                disastrous impact of climate change. This is well know among the
                people from whom you will be recruiting. The combination of
                rational and moral justification, combined with insights of the
                economical perks, will make your position unassailable.

              A protest against other individuals is aggressive and intrusive.
              Why not convince people with arguments instead?
            </h4>
            <p>
              Because arguments do not make people consume less. If they had,
              this crisis would have been over now. An explanation anyway:
              First, you will only reach out to those few who are already
              predisposed for the idea. The rest will ignore you. And even then,
              they will nod their heads, and fully agree with your arguments,
              and keep doing so until next time they are tempted with material
              satisfaction – upon which they will forget all you said, or make
              up an excuse for themselves. Consumption is not driven by ideas,
              but by emotions – positive emotions. Climate change, on the other
              hand, is just an idea – an abstract one, even. The idea of climate
              action simply cannot compete with the visceral satisfaction of
              acquiring something you wanted. Climate action needs to be
              competitive on the emotional level – and social influence is just
              that.

              Why not? Religions use shame to successfully influence societies
              with billions of people. Shame is a very powerful motivator,

              OK, so we’re doing this. But why so passive, why not go all the
              way? Blocking shopping malls? Sabotage? Shouting slogans,
              confronting people?
            </h4>
            <p>
              You are building a popular movement. To be successful, you must
              fulfill two criteria:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>1. Participation must be as easy as possible</li>
              <li>2. Opposition must be as difficult as possible</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Blocking, interrupting and sabotaging are not actions most people
              will willingly join. On the other hand, these acts will quickly
              motivate the rest of society to spend sufficient energy as to take
              action against your movement. What you want is to find a sweet
              spot where your people will feel safe and comfortable – while
              still being able to influence consumers’ choices – and be seen as
              too harmless to bother with breaking social norms or the law to
              remove. By the time they recognize the power of your movement, you
              will be too great for anyone to stop.

            <h4>So this will end climate change?</h4>
            <p>
              First and foremost, it will slow climate change. Immediate
              emission cuts will reduce the speed at which the crisis happens,
              which will purchase more time for other climate mitigation
              efforts, such as clean energy. Those efforts today, by themselves,
              are hopelessly inadequate to deal with the full crisis, as
              everybody knows deep down. Significantly reduced over-consumption
              will reduce the scope of the green transition and make it possible
              to achieve. Second, as your movement grows, people will see the
              climate struggle with new eyes: no longer hopeless. This will
              accelerate other forms of climate effort, triggering what is known
              as the collective tipping point, where most of humanity starts
              pulling in the same direction to deal with the crisis.

            <h4>So where should we protest?</h4>
            <p>
              A protest needs to happen in as close proximity as possible to
              where consumers make their decisions on over-consumption. When
              they are weighing price and hassle against material desire, you
              want to be there in their heads, tipping the scales. You want
              their kids to see you, and ask about the connection between
              consumption and climate change. You want to remind people about
              their climate concern, which they conveniently forgot before going
              out. The outside of a shopping mall (not the inside – as easy as
              possible, remember?) is probably an ideal location for this, but
              feel free to try other things.

            <p>
              Yes, the good old scourge of progressive action – the target
              audience going defensive, refusing to be convinced by your
              arguments. But our movement does not employ arguments – it uses
              emotional and social pressure. The thing about being defensive is
              that it is exhausting. Doing something out of spite costs a lot
              more energy than doing it out of ignorance. If you can keep the
              protests up, most people will change their behavior to get out of
              the emotional discomfort.

            <h2>What is the solution void?</h2>
            <p>
              Why is this document called “Filling the solution void”? The
              solution void is the core of our analysis, and is a rational take
              on why the world is failing so badly to deal with the climate
              crisis. The premise is that the current effort on the political,
              economical and technological level to combat climate change is
              insufficient to prevent global catastrophe – and everybody knows
              this, deep down. This creates an evil circle of emotional
              responses that blocks the search for a functional solution.
            </p>
          </article>

          <article class="article-story">
            <h4>The dysfunctions</h4>
            <p>
              Upon realizing that the struggle for the climate is lost, there
              are three main forms of reaction:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>1. Denial.</b> Climate change deniers, in their effort to
                make the bad feelings go away, sabotage the discourse on climate
                change and raise the stakes for participation.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>2. Distraction.</b> Most people, while formally acknowledging
                the climate reality, try to think of other things – and climate
                becomes a kind of seasoning on everyday issues. Society
                satisfies itself with minor course corrections, and never think
                about the issue for long enough to see realistic solutions.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>3. Defiance.</b> For many people, doing nothing about a
                crisis we have instigated, is immoral. Thus, we get a climate
                activist whose goal is to mitigate this negative feeling. The
                activist limits himself to fractions of a solution, with no care
                for assembling these into the global system required for
                producing large-scale emission cuts. Someone else can do that.
                Despite his endless defeats against polluters, the climate
                activist never critically assesses his own methods, because he
                does not need to: In the end, he values his own emotional payoff
                from participation, over the fate of the ecosystem. He does not
                desire victory enough to try new strategies.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              None of these three are in a position to produce a functional
              solution to climate change. And that is why the human effort to
              stop the catastrophe is failing.
            </p>
            <p>
              Until now. With the popular movement against over-consumption
              coming out of the left field, the rules of the game are turned
              around. A real solution is possible. And when that becomes
              apparent, the foundation for the solution void will dissolve. And
              that changes everything. The entire social reality of climate
              change – denial, pessimism, halfhearted plans; society’s deep
              lethargy – forget about all of it. Everybody gets to freely decide
              their stance over again. This is why the popular movement against
              over-consumption will bring about the collective tipping point,
              which will end the crisis.

            <h2>Some Goals</h2>
            <p>
              You need goals that you can use to mark your progress. I have some
              suggestions in the next paragraph. All of these should be
              attainable if you apply a cyclic method:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>1. Recruit participants</li>
              <li>2. Stage protests against private over-consumption</li>
              <li>3. Get attention</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              The input of the method is effort. All you need is available
              before you: people, time, materials for your signs, places to
              protest. No significant funds required, no political majority. And
              as you work, you might want to consider these goals:

            <h3>Short term</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>1. Successfully doing a protest.</b>The first achievement is
                to get enough people with you to participate. You should set a
                minimum number of participants for doing it, so that you can
                stand your ground together, as the position will feel highly
                visible and exposed. I suggest at least eight participants.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>2. Getting passers-by to join.</b>People going past your
                protest will contact you, offering criticism or encouragement.
                Convince one or more of them to join you, even just for five
                minutes
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>3. Have a protest in two locations simultaneously.</b>People
                will have seen this several places. It becomes a thing.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>4. Do protests consistently.</b>Endurance is extremely
                important in matters of climate activism. Getting enough people
                to join your cause so that you can consistently protest with
                more than the minimum number of participants whenever you want
                to, is a core goal of your movement. This is the main goal in
                the short term.

            <h3>Medium term</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>1. Media attention.</b>Get coverage in the local newspaper.
                This coverage can be collected and distributed to whomever you
                seek attention/participation from. Media attention allows you to
                recruit beyond your immediate social circle.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>2. Condemned in the media.</b>Getting a negative reaction
                visible to everyone is a sure sign that you are being noticed.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>3. Copycat protest group in different location.</b>This
                happens when your actions have garnered enough attention as to
                inspire climate concerned individuals elsewhere, and they
                initiate a similar protest. This is the most important goal of
                the whole movement, the difference between success and failure.
                Climate change is too great of a problem to be dealt with by one
                cohesive organization. Only with a loose popular movement,
                spreading spontaneously by example and inspiration, can you
                reach the scale needed for a global impact.

                <b>1. Copycat group in different country.</b>Copied abroad has
                greater impact than domestically, and less difficult. Climate
                concerned citizens exist in all nations, and will be picking up
                good ideas.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>2. Economical impact.</b>An industry or business visibly
                down-scaling or even going bankrupt, pointing to your movement
                as the cause, is a massive achievement that shows the power of
                social influence.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>3. Counter-protesters.</b>At one point, a counter-movement
                will appear, to defend the values of consumerism and the system.
                It will fail. Its members will do an even better job of scaring
                consumers off than you. The more angry, the better. Facts and
                morals are overwhelmingly on your side, and will power your
                motivation much more than theirs.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>4. Commercialization.</b>Endurance is extremely important in

                cause so that you can consistently protest with more than the
                minimum number of participants whenever you want to, is a core
                goal of your movement. This is the main goal in the short term.

            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
              I use the name Clausius for my writings, for I approach the
              subject of economics with the tools of the thermophysicist. The
              economy resembles an engine, where the only thing that matters is
              how much utility society can create with its economical inputs.
              Most of the details of economics have been made up by society in
              an attempt to by-pass this hard reality. The understanding of
              this, unlocks the insight that a popular movement against
              overconsumption is the only plausible way to fight climate change
              right now.

            <p>
              I have myself organized protests against overconsumption, in an
              attempt to get such a movement off the ground. We found the form
              of protest suitable for ordinary people. The failure lay in my own
              inability to inspire strangers to join, to get the movement over
              that first and greatest of hurdles. Thus, I have relegated myself
              to the second most important task: to distill and promote the idea
              of the movement against overconsumption, in the hope that you –
              the reader – will be the one who can create this movement and get
              it running.
