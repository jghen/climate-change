              So you have figured the wealthy are the real perpetrators behind
              climate change, and should be held responsible. And yes, there is
              definitely a moral connection between the wealthy elite and the
              carbon emissions from the industries they own. I do believe,
              however, that a climate movement that aims to solve the problem by
              holding the wealthy responsible, will be a failure on many levels

            <p>
              This one should be partly self-evident. Wealthy people have the
              capacity to motivate other people to come to their defense –
              legally, practically or violently. Their capacity for this is
              significantly greater than yours, which means that they will win
              the average conflict of interest between the two of you. And the
              matter is more complex: The source of wealth gives rich people
              another layer of defense from society. What is the source of
              wealth? The capacity to fulfill needs. People get rich whey they
              are able to perform desired tasks for, or deliver desired
              resources to people, that public society for various reasons will
              not or can not provide. If the rich are the source of desired
              goods and resources, society will give them considerable leeway
              from laws and moral imperatives that apply to normal people.
            </p>
            <p>
              What does your fight against the wealthy look like? What,
              specifically, do you intend to do to them, that will significantly
              reduce greenhouse gas emissions to the atmosphere? “Hold them
              responsible” is an empty phrase; what is the logical connection
              between your actions and the intended purpose? A popular answer to
              this question, is the banning of private jets. Never mind that
              private jets are only a trivial part of the global emissions
              problem, being the fraction of the size, and staying in the air
              for a fraction of the duration, of a commercial jet. You are
              banning them, which means that you need a parliamentary majority.
              How are you going about to get that? It would take a lot of
              convincing politicians and their voters. Democracy is a game of
              giving and taking. You would need to give away a lot on other
              policy issues to get the private jet ban. You are expending great
              deal of political capital for a climate victory that is symbolic,
              with minor global impact.
            </p>
            <p>
              You have neither the will, power or capability to significantly
              impact wealthy people’s carbon emissions. If your goal is to solve
              the problem, you need to set goals that you can reliably achieve.

            <h2>Proportionality</h2>
            <p>
              You have cited to me, many times, the famous claim that the
              wealthiest 1 % of the world’s population emits as much atmospheric
              carbon as the poorest 66 %, from the 2023
              <a
                href="https://www.oxfam.org/en/press-releases/richest-1-emit-much-planet-heating-pollution-two-thirds-humanity"
                target="_blank"
                rel="noopener noreferrer"
                >Oxfam report</a
              >. These two groups contribute 16 % of emissions each. An
              immediate observation: 16 % + 16 % is 32 % of global emissions
              from 1 % + 66 % = 67 % of the population. Which means the
              remaining 33 % of the world’s population – the middle class –
              creates 68 % of the global emissions. If the goal is to stop
              climate change by cutting as much emissions as possible, where do
              you try to make the greatest impact? With the rich, who have the
              power to stop you no matter what? With the poor, who struggle to
              get by? Or with the 68 % emissions source that is neither?
            </p>
            <p>
              Another observation: Even though the richest 1 % sounds like the
              absolute elite of wealthy people, 1 % of world population is 82
              million. There is a fair chance the 1 % statistic actually
              includes you.
            </p>
            <p>
              Let’s go deeper into the terms of the claim. The Oxfam report
              states that the richest 1 % provide emissions in three major ways:
              by their own lavish lifestyles, by their ownership in
              heavy-polluting industries, and by their power and interest in
              maintaining the status quo. Of these, the lifestyle emissions of
              yachts and planes, are a very small part of the picture, as
              demonstrated in the report. Investment and ownership, on the other
              hand, account for 50 to 70 % of the emissions of the 82 million
              wealthiest people. And this is where the logic immediately breaks.
              They own the polluting industry. But they are not the reason that
              the polluting industry exists. The industry exists because there
              is a massive demand for the goods and services provided by said
              industry. And this demand is created by the 1 % richest, plus the
              33 % second richest, part of the population. The rich are skimming
              the cream from the system that creates climate change. Which is
              obviously immoral... but climate change is not about morals, it is
              about numbers.
            </p>
            <p>
              You are reading this because you want to solve the problem and
              prevent climate change from destroying your life, the lives of
              your loved ones, and the things in the world that you enjoy. You
              need to be going after the numbers.

          <article class="article-story">
            <h2>Blaming</h2>
            <p>
              To blame is to look for answers outside the self (whom the blamer
              usually fails to target) for things that have gone amiss in life.
              It is to assign responsibility – rightfully or wrongly – in the
              hope that some social mechanism will trigger, and induce the
              blamed to amend the matter in the blamer’s favor. But when it
              comes to actually getting problems solved in a constructive sense,
              blaming has a terrible success rate. More often, it just breeds
              resentment between the parties, as the blamed almost never feels
              the blame is justified, and is never provided with the resources
              to amend the issue anyway by the blamer (part of the narrative is
              that the blamed already have the resources, but is withholding
              them for immoral reasons). The track record is so terrible that it
              is hard to imagine that anyone actually believes blaming is a
              valid tactic for solving problems. So why on earth do climate
              activists employ it as one of their chief methods of preventing
              global ecosystem collapse?
            </p>
            <p>
              The simplest reasonable explanation must be that blaming never was
              about problem-solving in the first place. It makes perfect sense
              when you look at how the traditional blamer systems work: pointing
              to a small social group and holding them responsible for the
              problems that are invariably caused by poor decision-making by
              society’s voting majority. Blaming the rich is sort of an odd one
              out, compared to blaming, say, the Jews, or liberated women, or
              third-world immigrants. The rich are genuinely resourceful, and
              bear what looks like responsibility for the problem – when you
              look at it very superficially. Therefore, blaming the rich does
              not carry the same shameful stigma among the politically
              enlightened, as blaming the poor. The rich can defend themselves.
              Blaming the rich is morally safe, because it has no noticeable
              consequences. Its irrelevance is what makes it viable. We should
              just conclude: Blaming the rich for climate change is something
              you do to fulfill a need for moral satisfaction about a problem
              that bothers you. In plain text: You do it because it makes you
              feel better.

            <h2>Synthesis: Hurting the rich from below</h2>
            <p>
              If you have read this far, and still feel a need to punish the
              rich for their blatantly immoral choices and actions in a global
              crisis, there is still a way: organized reduction of
              over-consumption. As we shall see from the other side page,
              <a
                href="/index_econ.html"
                target="_blank"
                rel="noopener noreferrer"
                >The economics of large-scale consumption reduction</a
              >
              , amassed wealth is strongly connected to the production and
              distribution of luxury products and services – directly through
              manufacturing and branding, or indirectly through fuel supply.
              Production of necessities is largely unprofitable without
              politically directed funding.
            </p>
            <p>
              Unlike other strategies for taking down the wealthy, there is not
              real counter to a large popular movement against over-consumption,
              if it gets going. A system of luxury production and distribution
              is fundamentally based on voluntary participation – you cannot
              forcibly induce middle-class citizens to spend their money on
              things that they do not need. As people stop demanding unnecessary
              products and services, the mechanisms for sustaining wealth are
              weakened. Unlike other strategies for taking down the wealthy,
              this does not create a vacuum ready to be filled by someone else.
